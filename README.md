Firstly, using "grep" function I determined the indices needed for the partial data import.
Then, after importing data, test and training sets were merged in total data set.
Activity labels have been transformed to actual activities.
And finally, total data set was grouped by subject and activity, after which the mean values were calculated for each measurement (column).
